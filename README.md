## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Generate Phone Number"

> Language: JavaScript
>
> Difficulty: Medium

### Objectives

- Create a function which takes a given argument consisting of numbers, `nums`.
- The output should be a new string that is a valid US phone number.

> i.e.:
>
> input => `8885653421`
>
> output => `'888-565-3421'`

#### Notes

- You must account for various data types for the argument input. (`nums` can be **either** an integer or an array of integers.)
- You do **not** need to account for `+1`, the United States country code.

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `npm i` from within the repo.
- Run `npm run test` or `npm test` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail.)
- Get hacking on the problem and test when you think you've got it!
